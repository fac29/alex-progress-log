- Determine appropriate scenarios for applying RESTful APIs (K7, S9, B2)

- Design endpoint structures for data creation, modification, and deletion (K11, S8, S12)

- Utilize Postman to test RESTful APIs independently of frontend components, ensuring proper functionality, error handling, and adherence to API specifications (S5, S6, S7)
